# AWS EC2 Apache Web Server Project

This repository contains the process and documentation for launching a basic web server on an Amazon EC2 instance.

## üöÄ Project Description

The goal of this project was to learn the fundamentals of cloud computing with AWS. This involved provisioning a virtual server (EC2), configuring its network and security settings, connecting to it via SSH, and installing and running an Apache web server to serve a simple HTML page.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **EC2 Instance:** Launched a `t2.micro` instance using the Amazon Linux 2 AMI.
-   **Security:** Configured a Security Group to allow inbound HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) traffic.
-   **Web Server:** Installed and enabled Apache (`httpd`).
-   **Custom Page:** Served a custom `index.html` page.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

-   Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    -   EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
    -   VPC (Security Groups)
-   Linux (Amazon Linux 2)
-   Apache Web Server (`httpd`)
-   SSH
-   Bash/Shell Scripting

## üìã Step-by-Step Process

The main steps taken to complete this project were:
1.  Created a key pair for secure SSH access.

2.  Launched the EC2 instance, configuring the AMI, instance type, and security group.
3.  Connected to the instance using an SSH client.

4.  Updated the system packages using `sudo yum update -y`.
5.  Installed Apache with `sudo yum install httpd -y`.
